\name{replicates_IS_ratio}
\alias{replicates_IS_ratio}
\title{Returns a dataframe containing the ratios between the number
of replicates for the considered type of IS in the control samples
and the number of replicates for the considered type of IS
in the other samples.}
\usage{
replicates_IS_ratio(af, matrix, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{af}{The association file}

\item{matrix}{The integration matrix}
}
\value{
Dataframe of values corresponding to the ratios
}
\description{
This function counts the number of replicates in which each shared IS
is found and sums them to obtain an overall count for each sample.
This function focuses on two categories of shared IS: the ones that are
known to belong to controls and the one that come from the other samples.
Also it considers the count for single subjects and for the overall
sum of these subjects, meaning that the ratio is computed against
each subjects replicate count and against the sum of the replicate
count of all subjects.
After computation of replicate count gives as output a dataframe
containing all the ratios, which includes information about the
sample considered, the ratio itself and the type of IS considered.
